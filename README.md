In our prototype, we mainly demonstrate the idea of branching pathways.

There are 7 areas in total, but in one playthrough you will only experience 3 areas.

Depending on the path you take in a level, you can end up in another level. 

In each level, there are different routes you can take. Depending on the level there can be a top route, a middle route and a lower route.
Depending on the route you take, you will end up in a different level. 

There are 4 endings. How you get to those endings is completely dependent on the route the player wishes to take.
We believe that the fun of this style of game will come from the player wanting to experiment and find new routes and levels.

The themes we have decided on for our game are:
The more moral choices aren't always the easiest choices to make.
and
Beauty requires persistence.

We believe we can incorporate these themes into our final game by having the different pathways reflect the decisions the player will make.
Perhaps if you want to make a more moral choice, you have to take the upper route. Perhaps though, the levels in the upper route
are much more difficult than the levels in the lower route. So even though the player may want to make the more moral choices,
it will be a lot more difficult to do so. Perhaps the most difficult ending to acheive is also the best ending you can get.
